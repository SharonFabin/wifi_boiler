## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/SharonFabin/wifi_boiler)

Remote boiler controller, compatiable with both web and mobile devices.

This project uses SSE as an asynchronous event driven live communication. Every connected user can choose how and when to turn on the
boiler from a remote position. All connected users or any new user can witness any changes to the boiler's state live. In addition, the program calculates at which times a user usually turns on the boiler and for how long to auto recommend for them the best experience with the boiler.
